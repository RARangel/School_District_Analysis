# Module 4: School District Analysis

## Overview

### Summary

A school board file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards.  The objective of this challenge was to use pandas to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the school district data intact. Once the math and reading scores have been replaced, the school district analysis needed to be re-run. This analysis describes how these changes affected the overall analysis.
